        I haven&apos;t got many hobbies. Mainly, it&apos;s because when I become
        too involved with something - I&apos;m getting too good at it. So I try
        not to (it&apos;s all for the sake of the next generation, really).
        <br />
        Hmm.. What else should I say? <br />I like eating sweets and enjoy my
        work.
